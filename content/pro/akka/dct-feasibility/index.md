<b>CLIENT:</b> TOYOTA MOTOR EUROPE (TME), as AKKA Consultant<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b><br>
Following the needs from TOYOTA MOTOR EUROPE for a drawing comparison tool, AKKA was in charge of producing a feasibility study document (jointly to developing a [Proof-Of-Concept application](/pro/akka/dct-poc)) in order to showcase its expertise.<br>
This document is thus AKKA's technical response to TME request of the feasibility study. It proposes a strategy to deliver a solution fully covering the specified requirements and taking into account the technical challenge.<br>
Following the offer and prototype development, AKKA was chosen by TME for the development of the [full scale project](/pro/tme/dct).<br>

<b>ROLE</b><br>
As Functional Analyst, I was responsible for writing the Feasibility Study document.<br>
By gathering and analysing the requirements, I had to do research and make decisions on the technical aspects and architecture of the system to develop, as well as setting up a realistic and acceptable development planning.<br>
