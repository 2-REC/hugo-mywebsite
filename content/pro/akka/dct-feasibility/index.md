<b>CLIENT:</b> TOYOTA MOTOR EUROPE (TME)<br>
<br>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
In response to TOYOTA MOTOR EUROPEâ€™s need for a drawing comparison tool, AKKA was tasked with delivering a feasibility study (alongside a <a href="pro/akka/dct-poc">proof-of-concept application</a>) to demonstrate its technical expertise.<br>
<br>
This document served as AKKA's official technical response to TME's request, outlining a strategy to meet all specified requirements while addressing the associated technical challenges.<br>
<br>
Following the successful presentation of the feasibility study and prototype, TME selected AKKA to develop the full-scale solution.<br>
<br>

<h3>ROLE</h3>
As Functional Analyst, I was responsible for authoring the Feasibility Study.<br>
My role involved gathering and analyzing requirements, conducting technical research, and making key architectural and design decisions.<br>
I also defined a realistic and achievable project plan to guide the implementation phase.<br>
