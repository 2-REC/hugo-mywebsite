<b>CLIENT:</b> TOYOTA MOTOR EUROPE (TME), as AKKA Consultant<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b><br>
Following the needs from TOYOTA MOTOR EUROPE for a drawing comparison tool, AKKA was in charge of producing a Feasibility Study document (jointly to developing a Proof-Of-Concept application) in order to showcase its expertise and convince TME to choose the company for the good realisation of the project.

<b>ROLE:</b><br>
As Functional Analyst, I was responsible for writing the Feasibility Study document.
By gathering and analysing the requirements, I had to do research and make decisions on the technical aspects and architecture of the system to develop, as well as setting up a realistic and acceptable development planning.
