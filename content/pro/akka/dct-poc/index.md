<b>CLIENT:</b> TOYOTA MOTOR EUROPE (TME), as AKKA Consultant<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b><br>
Following the needs from TOYOTA MOTOR EUROPE for a drawing comparison tool, AKKA was in charge of developing a Proof-Of-Concept application (jointly to producing a [feasibility study document](/pro/akka/dct-feasibility) in order to showcase its expertise.<br>
The prrof-of-concept tool allows a user to compare two revisions of a drawing by highlighting their differences. The process is streamlined and assists the engineers while still giving them full control over the results, greatly easing and improving their work.<br>
Following the offer and prototype development, AKKA was chosen by TME for the development of the [full scale project](/pro/tme/dct).<br>
Additionnally, the prototype was presented at the AKKA Awards contest, and was selected for the final in Berlin, where it reached the 2nd place.<br>

<b>ROLE</b><br>
As Team Leader and Project Manager, I was responsible for supervising the development team (composed of 4 developers) and being the point of interaction with the client.<br>
Worked on analysing and validating implementation choices while coaching junior developers in their work.<br>
