<b>CLIENT:</b> Toyota Motor Europe (TME)<br>
<br>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
In response to Toyota Motor Europe's request for a drawing comparison tool, AKKA developed a proof-of-concept application (alongside a <a href="pro/akka/dct-feasibility">feasibility study document</a>) to demonstrate its technical capabilities.<br>
<br>
The prototype enables users to compare two drawing revisions by automatically highlighting differences. The process streamlines engineers' workflows while maintaining full user control, significantly enhancing efficiency and accuracy.<br>
Following the successful delivery of both the offer and the prototype, TME selected AKKA to develop the <a href="pro/tme/dct">full-scale solution</a>.<br>
<br>
Additionally, the prototype was submitted to the AKKA Awards contest, where it was selected as a finalist and earned second place at the finals in Berlin.<br>
<br>

<h3>ROLE</h3>
As Team Leader and Project Manager, I oversaw a team of four developers and served as the main point of contact with the client.<br>
My responsibilities included validating technical decisions, analyzing implementation strategies, and mentoring junior developers throughout the project.<br>
