<b>CLIENT:</b> INFRABEL, as AKKA Consultant<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b><br>
In order to showcase AKKA's capabilities in image processing, the development of a prototype was imagined. Its role was to automatically detect and extract elements in 2D plans by using image recognition techniques, applied to the railway sector.

<b>ROLE:</b><br>
As Project Leader, I was responsible for the development of the prototype as well as coaching a junior Java developer.
Managed the successful realisation and demonstration of the prototype enabling the development team to be chosen for a larger scale project at INFRABEL (IFAST).
