<b>CLIENT:</b> SONACA, as AKKA consultant<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b><br>
The process of creating new commands and modules for CATIA V5 is long and error prone, but it follows a common repetitive process that can partially be automated. Additionally, developed tools at SONACA are often composed of similar elements and follow a similar pattern.
Hence, with my boss's approval, I imagined and developed a CAA development framework to greatly simplify the development process, automating a big part of the recurrent tasks. The framework could then be used in Visual Studio in conjunction with the CAA tools provided by Dassault Systemes.

<b>ROLE:</b><br>
As a CAD Tools Developer, I was responsible for the full realisation of the framework, from the initial feasibility analysis to the coding and testing. Once the framework functional, the process of creating new commands and modules in CATIA V5 was greatly simplified, significantly improving developers productivity.
