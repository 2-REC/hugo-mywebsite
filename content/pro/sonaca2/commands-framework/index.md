<b>CLIENT:</b> SONACA<br>
<br>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
The process of creating new commands and modules for CATIA V5 is lengthy and error-prone, yet follows a repetitive pattern that can be partially automated. Furthermore, many of the tools developed at SONACA share similar structures and patterns.<br>
<br>
With my manager’s approval, I designed and developed a CAA development framework aimed at significantly simplifying the development process by automating a large portion of the recurring tasks. This framework could be integrated into Visual Studio and used alongside the CAA tools provided by Dassault Systèmes.<br>
<br>

<h3>ROLE</h3>
As a CAD Tools Developer, I was responsible for the complete realization of the framework, from the initial feasibility study through to coding and testing.<br>
Once operational, the framework greatly streamlined the creation of new commands and modules in CATIA V5, leading to a substantial improvement in developers' productivity.<br>
