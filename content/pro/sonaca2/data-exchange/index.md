<b>CLIENT:</b> SONACA<br>
<br>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
In order to deliver the designed parts to the customers, a set of tools and scripts were developed. Their purpose was to automate and validate the data exchange processes, making sure everything was transferred flawlessly while being transparent to the users.<br>
<br>

<h3>ROLE</h3>
As a CAD Tools Developer, I was responsible for maintaining and debugging the tools, making sure the exchange processes were working correctly following changes on the customers side or after a system update.<br>
<br>
Additionally, with a VPM specialized co-worker, we developed data conversion tools allowing files to be exchanged between customers using different PLM systems, such as Dassault Systemes ENOVIA, Siemens Teamcenter and SAP PLM.<br>
