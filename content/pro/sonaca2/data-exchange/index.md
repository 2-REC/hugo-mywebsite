<b>CLIENT:</b> SONACA, as AKKA consultant<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b><br>
In order to deliver the designed parts to the customers, a set of tools and scripts were developed. Their purpose was to automate and validate the data exchange processes, making sure everything was transferred flawlessly while being transparent to the users.<br>

<b>ROLE:</b><br>
As a CAD Tools Developer, I was responsible for maintaining and debugging the tools, making sure the exchange processes were working correctly following changes on the customers side or after a system update.<br>
Additionally, with a colleague (VPM specialist), we had to develop data conversion tools allowing files to be exchanged between customers using different PLM systems, such as Dassault Systemes ENOVIA or Siemens Teamcenter.<br>
