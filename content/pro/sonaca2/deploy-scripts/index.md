<b>CLIENT:</b> SONACA, as AKKA consultant<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b><br>
For every new Service Pack and Hot Fix provided by Dassault Systemes for CATIA V5, all the developed tools have to be recompiled, eventually updated, and deployed.<br>
As different releases of CATIA V5 (R16, R17, R18, R19) on different operating systems (Windows & UNIX, 32 & 64 bits) are being used by the different projects, a big number of compilations and deployments is required, which is long, repetitive and error-prone.<br>
For this reason, I took the initiative to write scripts automating the compilation and deployments tasks for the different versions and configurations, greatly easing and accelerating the whole process otherwise done completely manually. The scripts are executed from an Excel file in which the user can configure the process depending on its needs and the different environments.<br>

<b>ROLE</b><br>
As a CAD Tools Developer, I imagined and implemented the different scripts, which then became part of the production process for all the internal CATIA V5 developments.<br>
