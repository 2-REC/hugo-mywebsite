<b>CLIENT:</b> SONACA<br>
<br>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
Each time a new Service Pack or Hot Fix is released by Dassault Syst√®mes for CATIA V5, all developed tools must be recompiled, updated if necessary, and deployed. Given that different CATIA V5 releases (R16, R17, R18, R19) are used across various projects on multiple operating systems (Windows & UNIX, 32-bit & 64-bit), this results in a large number of compilations and deployments, which is time-consuming, repetitive, and prone to errors.<br>
<br>
To address this challenge, I took the initiative to develop scripts that automate the compilation and deployment tasks across different versions and configurations. This automation greatly simplified and sped up the process, which was previously done manually. The scripts are executed from an Excel file, enabling users to configure the process according to their specific needs and environments.<br>
<br>

<h3>ROLE</h3>
As a CAD Tools Developer, I designed and implemented the scripts, which have since become an essential part of the production process for all internal CATIA V5 developments.<br>
