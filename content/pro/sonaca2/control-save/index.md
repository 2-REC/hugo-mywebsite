<b>CLIENT:</b> SONACA<br>
<br>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
Parts manufactured by SONACA must adhere to strict validation processes and comply with numerous security constraints. Every stage of the manufacturing process, including the design phase, must pass a series of tests to be validated.<br>
<br>
To support designers and enhance security, the "Control Save" process was introduced. Its purpose is to automatically perform a series of checks on designed parts every time users save their work. If any element fails validation, users are prompted to correct the issue before they can proceed saving.<br>
<br>

<h3>ROLE</h3>
As a CAD Tools Developer, I was responsible for the complete development of this command, from gathering requirements and validation rules from various departments and users, to its integration and validation within the production toolchain.<br>
