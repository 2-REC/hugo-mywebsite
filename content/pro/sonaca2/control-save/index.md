<b>CLIENT:</b> SONACA, as AKKA consultant<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b><br>
Parts manufactured by SONACA require to follow specific validation processes and to satisfy many security constraints. Every step of the manufacturing process, including the design, must thus satisfy a series of tests to be validated.<br>
In order to facilitate the designers? work, as well as providing a higher level of security, the Control Save process was requested. Its purpose is to execute a series of checks on the designed parts every time the designers and engineers save their work. If some elements do not pass all the tests, the user is requested to fix the issues until everything can be validated.<br>

<b>ROLE</b><br>
As a CAD Tools Developer, I was responsible for the full development of the command, from gathering the required information from the different departments and users regarding the constraints and validation rules, to the integration and validation in the production tool chain.<br>
