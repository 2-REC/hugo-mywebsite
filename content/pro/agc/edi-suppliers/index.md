DESCRIPTION:<br>
In order to ease and strengthen AGC's Supply Chain activities with its business partners, EDI was required between the company and its suppliers. The project thus consisted in setting up the first EDI communications with AGC's suppliers, starting with 3 selected suppliers from 4 different factories based in UK, Poland and Italy.<br>

ROLE:<br>
As a Functional Analyst, I was responsible for setting up the EDI communications with AGC's 3 selected suppliers. I was required to find the appropriate persons of contact and gather information in order to analyse and submit detailled technical offers to be accepted by the business and IT.
Once validated, I had to assign tasks to the development teams (located in Belgium and Brazil), follow the evolution and supervise the interactions between the different teams to make sure everything was done as planned.
Additionally to the EDI projects with suppliers, I was responsible for maintaining the existing communications with clients and manage new requirements requests.
