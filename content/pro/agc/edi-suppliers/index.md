<b>CLIENT:</b> AGC AUTOMOTIVE and its suppliers<br>
<br>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
To enhance and streamline AGC's supply chain operations, EDI integration was initiated with key suppliers.<br>
<br>
The project aimed to establish AGC's first EDI communications, starting with three selected suppliers across four factories:<br>
<ul>
<li>Nifco (UK & Poland)</li>
<li>Europlastics (Italy)</li>
<li>Sitet (Italy)</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3>ROLE</h3>
As Functional Analyst, I led the setup of EDI communications with these suppliers.<br>
<br>
My responsibilities included identifying the appropriate contacts, gathering technical and business information, and producing detailed technical proposals for validation by both business and IT stakeholders.<br>
Once approved, I coordinated task allocation to development teams based in Belgium and Brazil, tracked progress, and managed interactions between all parties to ensure smooth execution according to plan.<br>
<br>
In addition to the supplier integration project, I also maintained existing EDI communications with clients and handled incoming requests for new requirements.<br>
