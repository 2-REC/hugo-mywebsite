<b>CLIENT:</b> DACIA via AGC AUTOMOTIVE<br>
<br>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
Following a layout change to Dacia's labels, primarily the addition of a QR code, AGC's existing process required updates to meet the new specifications.<br>
<br>

<h3>ROLE</h3>
As Functional Analyst, I was responsible for analyzing the label changes and assessing their impact on current processes.<br>
<br>
Once the analysis was approved, I oversaw the implementation, coordinated with the development team, and validated the updates with the client to ensure alignment with requirements.<br>
