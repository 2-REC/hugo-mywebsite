<b>CLIENT:</b> AGC AUTOMOTIVE and DACIA, as AKKA Consultant<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b><br>
Following a change to the layout of the labels used at Dacia, consisting mostly in the addition of a QR code, the existing process used at AGC needs to be updated according to the new requirements.<br>

<b>ROLE:</b><br>
As a Functional Analyst, I was responsible for analysing the changes in the new label and evaluate the impacts on the current process. Once the analyse approved, I was responsible for supervising the development and validate the changes with the client.
