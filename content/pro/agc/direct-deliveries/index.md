<b>CLIENT:</b> AGC AUTOMOTIVE and VW<br>
<br>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
As part of the integration of VW Direct Deliveries into AGC's Supply Chain operations, significant updates to existing processes and EDI message exchanges were required, most notably the introduction of the new VDA4987 Global DESADV message.<br>
<br>

<h3>ROLE</h3>
In my role as Functional Analyst, I was responsible for analyzing the differences between the existing and new processes, assessing their impact on the current system, and preparing a comprehensive analysis for review and approval by the business stakeholders.<br>
