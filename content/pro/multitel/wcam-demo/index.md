<b>CLIENT:</b> European Commission, as a Multitel Research Engineer<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b><br>
Additionally to the development aspects of the [WCAM project](/pro/multitel/wcam), a demonstration video had to be made by Multitel.<br>
A part of the video had to explain the entire workflow of the developed solution, using 3D animations combined with real world video footage.<br>
The video was displayed at the WCAM booth during the [Annecy Animation Festival](https://www.annecy.org) in 2005.<br>

<b>ROLE</b><br>
I was responsible for the realisation of the part about the solution workflow.<br>
The scene was composed of a 3D representation of the Annecy's animation festival main hall, with integrated video footage of the site and other locations.<br>
I did the 3D modeling as well as the integration with the video shots.<br>
Additionally, I contributed to the video by doing some directing, figuration, staging, filming, editing with the other team members.<br>
