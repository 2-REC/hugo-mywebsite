<b>CLIENT:</b> European Commission, as a Multitel Research Engineer<br>
<br>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
In addition to the development work on the <a href="pro/multitel/wcam">WCAM project</a>, Multitel was tasked with producing a demonstration video.<br>
Part of the video showcased the complete workflow of the developed solution, combining 3D animations with real-world video footage.<br>
The final video was presented at the WCAM booth during the <a href="https://www.annecyfestival.com/en" target="_blank">Annecy Animation Film Festival</a> in 2005.<br>
<br>

<h3>ROLE</h3>
I was responsible for creating the section of the video that explained the solution workflow.<br>
The scene featured a 3D representation of the main hall at the Annecy Animation Festival, integrated with real video footage from the site and other locations.<br>
I handled both the 3D modeling and the integration of the video footage.<br>
Additionally, I contributed to the overall production by helping with directing, acting, staging, filming, and editing alongside the rest of the team.<br>
