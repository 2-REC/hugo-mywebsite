<b>CLIENT:</b> City of Antwerp, as a Multitel Research Engineer<br>
<br>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
The project was initiated following a request from the City of Antwerp, willing to install our video surveillance and traffic management system in tunnels across the city.<br>
To determine the optimal camera placement, and to validate and train our system, 3D models of the tunnels were needed.<br>
As a first step, three newly constructed tunnels were selected for the project.<br>
<br>

<h3>ROLE</h3>
As a 3D Modeler, I was responsible for modeling the 3 tunnels, based on provided 2D plans. The modeling was done in Blender.<br>
