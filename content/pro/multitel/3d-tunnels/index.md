<b>CLIENT:</b> City of Antwerp, as a Multitel Research Engineer<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b><br>
The project came following a request from the City of Antwerp willing to install our video surveillance and traffic management system in the tunnels throughout the city.<br>
In order to determine the optimal positioning of the cameras in the tunnels, as well as validating and training our system, 3D models of the tunnels were required.<br>
As a first step, 3 new tunnels under construction were selected.<br>

<b>ROLE</b><br>
As a 3D Modeler, I was responsible for modeling the 3 tunnels, based on provided 2D plans. The modeling had to be as close as possible to the plans, respecting the dimensions and materials.<br>
