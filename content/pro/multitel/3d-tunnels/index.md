<b>CLIENT:</b> City of Antwerp, as a Multitel Research Engineer<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b><br>
The project came following a request from the City of Antwerp willing to install our video surveillance and traffic management system in the tunnels throughout the city,
In order to determine the optimal positioning of the cameras in the tunnels, as well as validating and training our system, 3D models of the tunnels were required.
As a first step, 3 new tunnels under construction were selected. 

<b>ROLE:</b><br>
As a 3D Modeler, I was responsible for modeling the 3 tunnels, based on provided 2D plans. The modeling had to be as close as possible to the plans, respecting the dimensions and materials.
