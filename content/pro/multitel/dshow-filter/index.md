<b>CLIENT:</b> Quadrox, as a Multitel Research Engineer<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b><br>
... (from doc?)

<b>ROLE:</b><br>
As a Software Developer, I was responsible for the development and integration of a video surveillance DirectShow filter aimed at counting people crossing a defined area, using the in-house developed image analysis module "MvPeopleCounting".
The module and part of the MVision framework had first to be ported to Windows.
