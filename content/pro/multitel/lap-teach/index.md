<b>CLIENT:</b> Medsys, as a Multitel Research Engineer<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b><br>
The LapTeach application was requested by Medsys as part of their training solutions.
It is a module developed for the LapMan to enable Tele-Scope-Mentoring (TSM).
It allows the mentor to visualise the images from the operation room in real-time, and to remotely take control of the LapMan to share expertise with the surgeon at work. It also allows users to draw simple 2D shapes in real-time overlayed to the video in order to provide directions to other users.

<b>ROLE:</b><br>
As a Software Developer, I was responsible for the server side of the application. Its role was to receive the video streams, encode them and transfer them to the connected clients.
Additionally to the video, data streams were handled, containing 2D geometric data created by users (to be added as overlay on the video in real-time on the client-side).
