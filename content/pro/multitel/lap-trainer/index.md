<b>CLIENT:</b> Medsys, as a Multitel Research Engineer<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b><br>
The LapTrainer application was requested by Medsys as part of their training solutions.
Its purpose is to simulate the LapMan robot (remote surgical intervention robot) in order to allow users to practice and get familiar to its handling without having to use the real device. By using a LapStick or a LapRemote, users can thus do in a virtual way the operations they would do on a real LapMan robot.
The application is a 3D virtual environment in which users can practice real-time navigation operations.

<b>ROLE</b><br>
As a Software Developer, I was responsible for the analysis and development of the application.
Gathering requirements from the client, analysing them, and developing the real-time 3D simulator.
I also had to create 3D scenes to be used as different environments in the simulator.
