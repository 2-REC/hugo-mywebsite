<b>CLIENT:</b> Medsys, as a Multitel Research Engineer<br>
<br>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
The LapTrainer application was developed at the request of Medsys as part of their training solutions.<br>
Its purpose is to simulate the LapMan robot (a remote surgical intervention robot), allowing users to practice and become familiar with its operation without needing the actual device. By using a LapStick or a LapRemote, users can perform virtually the same actions they would on a real LapMan robot.<br>
The application provides 3D virtual environments where users can practice real-time navigation and operational skills.<br>
<br>

<h3>ROLE</h3>
As a Software Developer, I was responsible for the analysis and development of the application.<br>
My role included gathering requirements from the client, analyzing them, and developing the real-time 3D simulator.<br>
I also had to create 3D scenes to be used as different environments within the simulator.<br>
<br>
The application was developed in C++ using the OGRE engine with OpenGL and DirectX. The 3D environments were created in Blender.<br>
