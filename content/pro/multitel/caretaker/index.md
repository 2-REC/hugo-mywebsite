<b>CLIENT:</b> European Commission, as a Multitel Research Engineer<br>
<br>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
Project initiated in the context of the European FP6 Program.<br>

<i>
"The CARETAKER project aims at studying, developing and assessing multimedia knowledge-based content analysis, knowledge extraction components, and metadata management sub-systems in the context of automated situation awareness, diagnosis and decision support. More precisely, CARETAKER will focus on the extraction of a structured knowledge from large multimedia collections recorded over networks of camera and microphones deployed in real sites. The produced audio-visual streams, in addition to surveillance and safety issues, could represent a useful source of information if stored and automatically analyzed, in urban planning and resource optimization for instance."<br>
