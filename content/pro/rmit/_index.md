<h3>JOB DESCRIPTION</h3>
It all began at the <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.vn/vi/tin-tuc/tat-ca-tin-tuc/2018/thang-6/developing-vietnam-s-capacity-in-digital-learning-and-teaching1" target="_blank">EdTech Vietnam 2018 conference</a> held at RMIT University Vietnam, where I had the opportunity to meet Mr. Ondris Pui following his presentation on the role of emerging technologies in education.<br>
<br>
After an engaging discussion, we found a shared interest and quickly connected. He invited me to visit the university's mixed reality lab.
From then, we decided to work together on a research project, centered around these emerging technologies.<br>
<br>
We assembled a four-member team, including another teacher and a student, and began brainstorming ideas and exploring practical implementation strategies.<br>
Our collaboration involved weekly meetings at the RMIT mixed reality lab, with additional independent work during our available time.<br>
<br>
We wanted to focus on developing a project that blends entertainment with physical activity.<br>
It was inspired by several key research insights:
<ul>
<li>People are generally not engaging in enough physical activity.</li>
<li>There is a need to encourage more physical engagement and reduce sedentary behavior.</li>
<li>Group-based play encourages social interaction, which contributes to both physical and mental well-being.</li>
<li>The concept aligns with the habits and preferences of Generation Z, who are deeply connected to mobile technology.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Beyond gameplay, the experience should raise awareness about physical inactivity and provide insights into each participant's health and fitness levels.<br>
<br>

<h3>RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
I worked part-time as a volunteer.<br>
<br>
Research and development tasks were shared among the team, with everyone contributing ideas and engaging in collaborative brainstorming.<br>
Though as I was the only developer on the team, I was in charge of the technical and software development aspects.<br>
