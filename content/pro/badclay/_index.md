In 2022, <a href="https://www.bad-clay.com/" target="_blank">Bad Clay Studio</a> co-founded <a href="https://aioi.io/" target="_blank">AIOI Studios</a>.<br>

I was tasked with setting up a VFX pipeline to support and streamline daily workflows of artists and production teams.<br>

Key Contributions:

<li>Development of pipeline tools in Python+Qt to streamline asset management in Maya (QC, import/export, conversions, etc.), significantly improving efficiency and enabling the successful delivery of hundreds of shots for major productions</li>
<li>Extension of the open-source VFX pipeline framework Mangrove, to automate Maya scene build and updates from scene descriptions, used extensively on a massive 600+ VFX shots movie</li>
<li>Creation of a wide range of utility scripts (Python, Shell, MEL, Hython, MAXScript) to export, convert, clean, and archive asset and shot data across DCCs, and to streamline delivery workflows</li>
</ul>


<h3>RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
As the sole developer at the studio, I was fully responsible for setting up and managing the entire VFX pipeline.<br>
<br>

<ul>
