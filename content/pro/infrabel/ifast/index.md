<b>CLIENT:</b> INFRABEL, TUC-RAIL and SNCB, as AKKA Consultant<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b><br>
The IFAST application, part of the global Testing Tools Shelter (TTS) project, aims at assisting the testing of the PLP modules in the shelter in a digital semi-automatic manner.<br>
Previously, the process was done by manually filling test sheets (NT22).<br>
Thanks to the IFAST project, the testing and filling of the NT22 can now be done digitally, through the user interface of the IFAST-GUI on a tablet device. It takes as input an IFAST project file produced by the IFAST-Prep tool and gives as an output the filled in NT22 sheets.<br>
The IFAST poject thus greatly eases and accelerates the process of PLP shelter testing. It also ensures no tests are forgotten and that the testing results are valid.<br>

<b>ROLE:</b><br>
As part of the development team, I was mostly responsible for the implementation of the sheet management system, allowing to display and edit the sheets in the application, as well as being able to print them in a format identical to the original paper forms.<br>
I was also in charge of developing most of the UI for the tablet application.<br>
