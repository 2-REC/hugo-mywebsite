<b>CLIENT:</b> INFRABEL, TUC RAIL and SNCB<br>
<br>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
The IFAST application, part of the global Testing Tools Shelter project (TTS), aims at assisting the testing of the PLP modules in the shelter in a digital semi-automatic manner. Previously, the process was done by manually filling test sheets (NT22).<br>
<br>
Thanks to the IFAST project, the testing and filling of the NT22 can now be done digitally on a tablet device, through the user interface of the IFAST-GUI. It takes an IFAST project file produced by the IFAST-Prep tool as input and generates the filled in NT22 sheets as output.<br>
<br>
The IFAST poject thus greatly eases and accelerates the process of PLP shelter testing. It also ensures no tests are forgotten and that the testing results are valid.<br>
<br>

<h3>ROLE</h3>
As part of the development team, I was mostly responsible for the implementation of the sheet management system, allowing to display and edit the sheets in the application, as well as being able to print them in a format identical to the original paper forms.<br>
<br>
I was also in charge of developing most of the UI for the tablet application.<br>
