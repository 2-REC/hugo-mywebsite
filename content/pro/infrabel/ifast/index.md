<b>CLIENT:</b> INFRABEL, TUC RAIL and SNCB<br>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
The IFAST application, part of the global Testing Tools Shelter project (TTS), aims at assisting the testing of the PLP modules in the shelter in a digital semi-automatic manner. Previously, the process was done by manually filling test sheets (NT22).<br>
<br>
Thanks to the IFAST project, the testing and filling of the NT22 can now be done digitally on a Windows tablet device, through the user interface of the IFAST-GUI. It takes an IFAST project file produced by the IFAST-Prep tool as input and generates the filled in NT22 sheets as output.<br>
<br>
The IFAST poject thus greatly eases and accelerates the process of PLP shelter testing. It also ensures no tests are forgotten and that the testing results are valid.<br>
<br>

<h3>ROLE</h3>
As part of a 3 members development team, I led the implementation of the sheet management system, enabling users to view, edit, and print digital sheets with layouts closely matching the original paper forms.<br>
The system dynamically generated HTML pages based on a custom set of UI components and layout rules, styled with CSS to faithfully replicate the printed forms. User interaction was handled through JavaScript, providing a responsive and intuitive experience.<br>
<br>
I also developed parts of the tablet application's user interface using JavaFX. Its cross-platform capabilities and UI toolkit streamlined development and ensured seamless integration of the application different components.<br>
<br>
Throughout the project, we provided guidance and support to a junior team member, helping him in his first full-scale professional development experience.<br>
