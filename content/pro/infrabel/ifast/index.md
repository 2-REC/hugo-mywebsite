<b>CLIENT:</b> INFRABEL, as AKKA Consultant<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b><br>
Development of a tablet application to digitise and partly automate the process of railway shelter field-testing, greatly increasing the workers productivity.

<b>ROLE:</b><br>
As part of the development team, I was mostly responsible for the implementation of the sheet management system, allowing to display and edit the sheets in the application, as well as being able to print them in a format identical to the original paper forms.
I was also in charge of developing most of the UI for the tablet application.

(images? IFAST logo, sheets (blurred/parts...?)? IFAST UI?
