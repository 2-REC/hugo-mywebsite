<b>CLIENT:</b> SONACA and customers, as external consultant<br>
<br>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
Manually modelling and placing holes and fasteners on 3D models of airplane wings is a tedious task.<br>
To facilitate and speed up the process, while also providing checks and validation, a set of tools was requested to be developed and integrated in CATIA V5 as a new module.<br>
<br>

<h3>ROLE</h3>
As a CAD Tools Developer, I was responsible for the full development and testing of the different tools, the design of their GUI and their integration in CATIA V5.<br>
