<b>CLIENT:</b> SONACA and customers, as external consultant<br>
<br>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
Additionally to the CATIA V5 Extension tools and modules, a set of macros were developed to assist and automate part of the designers and engineers recurrent tasks.<br>
<br>

<h3>ROLE</h3>
As a CAD Tools Developer, I was responsible for maintaining the macros as well as providing support to the users. I was also responsible for the development of several new macros to provide additional tools to the different departments.<br>
<br>
While the main tools and modules were developed in C++ using the CAA RADE framework, the macros were implemented using VBA and CATScript (the scripting language developed by Dassault Syst√®mes, similar to VBScript).<br>
