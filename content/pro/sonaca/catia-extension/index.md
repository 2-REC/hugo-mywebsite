<b>CLIENT:</b> SONACA and customers, as external consultant<br>
<br>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
At SONACA, where manufactured parts are destined for the aerospace industry, designers and engineers frequently perform a range of specific, repetitive tasks.<br>
To support and streamline their work, a suite of commands and tools has been developed over the years, significantly extending the capabilities of the CATIA V5 design software.<br>

The main tools I worked on included:<br>
<ul>
<li><b>Rule Design Inspector:</b> A tool that verifies whether CAD models comply with a predefined set of rules, either by highlighting invalid components or by automatically applying the required corrections, thus validating the engineers' work.</li>
<li><b>Smooth Surface:</b> A tool that generates a single, smooth, continuous surface from a set of separate surfaces, closely following the original ones. Parametrization options allow control over aspects such as maximum curvature, surface thickness, and the precision with which the new surface follows the originals.</li>
<li><b>Sheet Creation:</b> A tool that generates cutting plans for machining operations, providing machine-specific information based on the selected configuration. The generated plans can be automatically interpreted by cutting machines to guide the fabrication of metal sheet parts.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3>ROLE</h3>
As a CAD Tools Developer, I was responsible for the maintenance and support of existing tools, as well as for the development of new ones based on the evolving needs of the various departments.<br>
