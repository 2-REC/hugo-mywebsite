<b>CLIENT:</b> SONACA, as external consultant<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b><br>
A tool had to be developed in order to allow users from the different departments with different roles to use a customised configuration of the CATIA V5 design software.<br>
The standalone tool lets a user select between different releases of the software and specific profiles depending on their needs (and permissions). It automatically configures the environment and starts the execution of CATIA V5, loading the requested modules and plugins.<br>

<b>ROLE</b><br>
As a CAD Tools Developer, I was responsible to rewrite a new version of the tool porting it from VBA to VB .NET, as well as adding new options and security checks.<br>
