<b>CLIENT:</b> SONACA, as external consultant<br>
<br>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
A tool was needed to enable users from different departments, each with distinct roles, to access customized configurations of the CATIA V5 design software.<br>
This standalone application allows users to select between various releases of the software and specific profiles based on their needs and permissions. It then automatically configures the environment and launches CATIA V5, loading the required modules and plugins.<br>
<br>

<h3>ROLE</h3>
As a CAD Tools Developer, I was responsible for rewriting the tool, migrating it from VBA to VB.NET, while also adding new features and implementing enhanced security checks.<br>
