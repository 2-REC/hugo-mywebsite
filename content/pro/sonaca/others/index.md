<b>CLIENT:</b> SONACA and customers, as external consultant<br>
<br>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
Additional tools were developed to further support users and managers in their daily activities. Some tools were requested by managers to simplify user management tasks and environment configurations, while others were designed to assist designers and engineers with their work, validation processes, as well as data exchange, archiving, and project follow-up.<br>
<br>

<h3>ROLE</h3>
As a CAD Tools Developer, I was responsible for the full development cycle of these tools. Starting from requests made by team leaders or key users, I analyzed the requirements, proposed technical solutions with associated offers for management approval, and subsequently handled the development, testing, and integration of the tools into the production environments.<br>
