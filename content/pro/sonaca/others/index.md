<b>CLIENT:</b> SONACA, as external consultant<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b><br>
More tools had to be developed to assist the users and managers in their work. Some tools were requested by the managers to ease their user management tasks and environments configurations. Other tools were destined to the designers and engineers to assist and validate their work, and help them in the exchange, archiving and follow-up processes.

<b>ROLE:</b><br>
As a CAD Tools Developer, I was responsible for the development of all these tools. From a request coming from the team leaders or some specific key users, I had to analyse and submit an offer to be validated by the management. I was then in charge of developing, testing and integrating the tools in the production environments.
