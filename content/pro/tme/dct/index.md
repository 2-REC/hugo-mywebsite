Description:<br>
Development of a complete software solution to greatly streamline the comparison process between 2 revisions of a technical drawing, otherwise done manually by engineers.<br>
AKKA was assigned the project thanks to the Feasibility Study document and the Proof-Of-Concept tool provided to TME.<br>

ROLE:<br>
As Technical Leader, I was responsible for analysing and determining the appropriate technologies and implementation choices, and to validate them with the business and management (following the Technical Offer that had been made to the client with the Feasibility Study).
I was also responsible for managing the development team (composed of 4 developers) and making sure the requirements and planning were respected, as well as being the point of interaction between the technical team, the management and the client.
Additionally to supervising the development, I also worked on some of the UI aspects of the front-end, mostly on the viewport related code.
