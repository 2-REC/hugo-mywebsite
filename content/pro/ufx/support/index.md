<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
Provide daily technical support to artists and production teams by diagnosing issues and offering workflow solutions.<br>
Proactively enhance pipeline efficiency by identifying performance bottlenecks and recommending or implementing improvements.<br>
<br>

<h3>ROLE</h3>
As part of the support team:
<ul>
<li>Manage tickets through the Redmine issue tracking system, investigating user reported problems and requests to deliver effective solutions.</li>
<li>Maintain and improve existing pipeline tools by performing troubleshooting, bug fixes, and implementing new features or user requested updates.</li>
<li>Deliver comprehensive pipeline support across tools such as ShotGrid/Flow, Nuke, Maya, and Gaffer, along with general Linux system assistance.</li>
</ul>
Additionally, for a brief period of approximately one month, I mentored an intern who was completing her design studies and exploring the field of VFX and pipeline TD.<br>
My guidance focused primarily on introducing her to algorithmic thinking and Python programming.<br>
