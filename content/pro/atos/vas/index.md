<b>CLIENT:</b> ATOS WORLDLINE and JADE-I<br>
<br>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
Development of embedded survey and advertising tools for YOMANI payment terminals in order to extend their functionalities and provide a better user experience.<br>
<br>
The purpose of the "Advertisement Value Added Service" is to enable advertising on the terminal’s screen. Advertisements are shown on the terminal display when the terminal is in idle mode.<br>
Advertisement content and contract management is managed by a central management system.<br>
<br>
The purpose of the "Survey Value Added Service" is to enable surveys on the terminal’s screen. Surveys are shown on the terminal display when a payment has been successfully done.<br>
It presents a series of questions asking for a 1 to 10 service satisfaction. These questions and the provided answers are managed by a central management system (managed by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/jade-i" target="_blank">Jade-I</a>).<br>
<br>

<h3>ROLE</h3>
As a developer, I was mostly responsible for the telecommunications module, encoding and decoding messages exchanged between the terminals and secured servers.<br>
<br>
Additionally, I was responsible for the coordination between the different teams and departments in Brussels and Luxembourg, in order to validate and present the final products to the management and clients.<br>
