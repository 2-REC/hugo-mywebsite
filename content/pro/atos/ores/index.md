<b>CLIENT:</b> ATOS WORLDLINE, ORES and BANKSYS<br>

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b><br>
Development of an embedded top-up management system on XENTA and YOMANI payment terminals aimed to the "Core Reload Management" that is part of the Prepaid Reload for Ores.<br>
The "Core Reload Management" is used to enable customers of GRDs (Gestionnaire de r√©seau de distribution, distribution company) to pay money via different payment channels onto a prepaid account and load the money from that account to a smartcard.<br>
The smartcard is used to enable a gas or electricity meter for the corresponding energy amount.<br>

<b>ROLE:</b><br>
As a developer, I was mostly responsible for the telecommunications module, encoding and decoding messages exchanged between the terminals and secured servers.<br>
