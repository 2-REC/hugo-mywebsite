<b>CLIENT:</b> ATOS WORLDLINE, ORES and BANKSYS<br>
<br>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
Development of an embedded top-up management system on XENTA and YOMANI payment terminals, as part of the "Core Reload Management" system within the Prepaid Reload solution for <a href="https://www.ores.be" target="_blank">ORES</a>.<br>
The "Core Reload Management" system allows customers of GRDs (Distribution System Operators) to transfer funds via various payment channels into a prepaid account and then load those funds onto a smartcard.<br>
The smartcard is subsequently used to activate a gas or electricity meter with the corresponding energy amount.<br>
<br>

<h3>ROLE</h3>
As a developer, I was primarily responsible for the telecommunications module written in C, handling the encoding and decoding of messages exchanged between the payment terminals and secured servers.<br>
Test servers used to mimick transactions were developed in Python.<br>
