    As a freelancer, I offer development <a id="about_services_link" class="page-jump" href="#services">services</a> to help bring your project to life.  

    Whether you're starting from the ground up or enhancing an existing system,
    I specialize in developing both standalone applications and integrated tools tailored to your needs,
    from initial prototypes to fully finished products.  

    I’m also available to collaborate with you or support your team at any stage of the development process.


    Software developer since the early 2000s,
    I've been working on numerous <a class="page-jump" href="#projects_pro">projects for several companies across a wide range of industries</a>.


    My experience spans from CAD and image analysis tools to web and embedded applications,
    in domains ranging from aerospace and automotive to video games and VFX.  

    Over the years, I’ve taken on nearly every role in a project’s lifecycle:
    Project Leader, Functional Analyst, Architect, Developer and QA Engineer to name a few.


    This journey has given me a broad and <a class="page-jump" href="#skills">versatile skill set</a>,
    along with deep expertise in various technologies and methodologies.


    Outside of my professional work, I pursue personal projects,
    mainly around video games, mobile apps, and web design.
    I also enjoy writing blogs about topics that matter to me and that I want to share.


    This website showcases my work in software development and IT related fields,
    and acts as a companion to my <a class="page-jump" href="#skills">resume</a>.


    If you're curious to learn more or have a project in mind, feel free to <a class="page-jump" href="#contact">reach out</a>.  

    I'm based between Brussels, Belgium, and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.
