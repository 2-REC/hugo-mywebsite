    I offer development <a id="about_services_link" class="page-jump" href="#services">services</a> to turn software ideas into reality.<br>
    <br>
    Whether building a system from the ground up or improving and extending existing solutions, I specialize in developing both standalone applications and integrated tools, tailored to specific needs.<br>
    From early-stage prototypes to production-ready systems, I offer support at any phase of the development lifecycle, either independently or as part of a team.<br>
    <br>
    Since the early 2000s, I've collaborated on numerous <a class="page-jump" href="#projects_pro">projects with companies across a wide range of industries</a>, including aerospace, automotive, banking, security, video games, and visual effects.<br>
    My experience covers diverse technical domains, from CAD and image processing to web development and embedded systems.<br>
    Over the years, I've taken on nearly every role in a project's lifecycle: Project Lead, Functional Analyst, Architect, Developer and QA Engineer to name a few.<br>
    This journey has given me a broad and <a class="page-jump" href="#skills">versatile skill set</a>, along with deep expertise in various technologies and methodologies.<br>
    <br>
    This website showcases my professional work in software development and IT related fields.<br>
    It also serves as a companion to my <a class="page-jump" href="#skills">resume</a>.<br>
    <br>
    Outside of professional work, I enjoy working on personal projects in game development and web design, as well as sharing thoughts and interests through blogging.<br>
    <br>
    I live in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, but regularly spend time in Brussels, Belgium, where I'm originally from.<br>
    <br>
    If you have a project in mind or just want to connect, please feel free to <a class="page-jump" href="#contact">reach out</a>.
