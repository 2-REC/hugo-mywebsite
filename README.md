# MyWebsite

Website showcasing the different projects I have been working on both professionally and personally.

This is my first website, done with HUGO, using the theme ["MyPortfolio"](https://github.com/2-REC/hugo-myportfolio-theme) (developed by myself).

After cloning the repository, it is required to clone the submodule as well.\
This can be done the first time with the following command:\
    git submodule update --init --recursive

Later, the submodule directory can be used as a normal Git repository.
