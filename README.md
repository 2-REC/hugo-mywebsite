# IT Portfolio

## Description

Website showcasing the different projects I have been working on both professionally.

(personal projects will be added later)


This is my first website, done with HUGO, using the theme ["MyPortfolio"](https://github.com/2-REC/hugo-myportfolio-theme).

The website is available [here](https://2-rec.github.io/it-portfolio).


# Usage

After cloning the repository, it is required to clone the submodule as well.

This can be done the first time with the following command:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
